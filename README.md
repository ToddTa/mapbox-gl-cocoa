# MVKMapKit

This is a Cocoa API wrapper for [`llmr-native`](https://github.com/mapbox/llmr-native). Use or edit this project to get access to Mapbox vector maps in your iOS apps by using `MVKMapView`. It currently is included as a submodule of `llmr-native` but will eventually stand alone with a static library version of `llmr-native` included for easy use in projects.
